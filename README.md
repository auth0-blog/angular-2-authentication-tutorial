# Daily Deals

Daily Deals is an application built with Angular that shows how you can add token based authentication to your Angular applications. You can read the full tutorial for this project here: [Angular Authentication Tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/angular-2-authentication/).

# Running the App

You will need to run both the Node.js server located in the `server` directory and Angular front-end located in the `ng2auth` directory. See each of the project directories for detailed instructions on how to run the projects. You will need an Auth0 account, so if you don't already have one, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for a free account today. 

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
